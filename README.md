# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I implemented test suites with Jasmine to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

The main goal of the project was to become more familiar with testing, test-driven development, and Jasmine, as well as practice analyzing multiple aspects of an existing application.
